# Fonts Directory

This directory should contain the following font files:

- `LifeCraft_Font.ttf` - Used for WoW-themed headings and decorative text

Due to licensing restrictions, please download the appropriate fonts and place them in this directory.

## Alternative Approach

If font files cannot be included, the CSS has been modified to fall back to system fonts.
